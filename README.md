## General info
This project was to create a fully functioning e-commerce app from scratch. <br/>
It uses React/Redux for a server-side front-end. <br/>
It uses PostgreSQL for the database. <br/>
And it uses Express.js to connect the two.

## How To Use
1. After first downloading the project, run the command:
```
npm install
```
2. Then in the root directory, run:
```
node server.js
```
This starts the express server so the app can connect to the database. <br/>

3. While the server is still running, run the command:
```
npm start
```
This starts the react app and you will be redirected to localhost://3003.
